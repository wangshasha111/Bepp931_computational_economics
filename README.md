# Methods in Computational Economics

 This folder contains all the solutions to the homework assignments for the course "Computational Economics."

 This is a math-and-coding-heavy course, very rewarding. Every problem set folder contains a writeup for the answers. I strongly recommend this course to everyone who loves math and coding.
