# Methods in Computational Economics

 This folder contains all the solutions to the homework assignments for the course "Computational Economics."

 This is a math-and-coding-heavy course, very rewarding. Every problem set folder contains a writeup for the answers. I strongly recommend this course to everyone who loves math and coding.

 ## Project 1
 solving linear equations
 
 ## Project 2
 Gauss-Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel iteration
 
 ## Project 3
 optimization comparison: fminsearch VS fminunc

 
 ## Project 4
 solving non-linear equations

 
 ## Project 5
 Single Hidden layer Feed forward Neural Network

 
 ## Project 6
 integration and approximation

 
 ## Project 7
 projection method and finite difference method

 
 ## Project 8
 optimal growth path
  

 
 ## Project 9
quality ladder
